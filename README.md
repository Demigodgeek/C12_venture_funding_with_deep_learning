## About The Project

This project use machine learning and neural networks alone with the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business. The steps for this project are broken out into the following sections:

* Prepare the data for use on a neural network model.
* Compile and evaluate a binary classification model using a neural network.
* Optimize the neural network model.

## Installation

This project leverages python 3.8 with the following packages:

+ pandas 
+ pathlib
+ tensorflow
+ keras
+ scikit_learn

### Installation Guide(MacOS & Windows)

1.  Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.
2.  for Windows user, you can install these libraries using pip by running the following command in your bash:
    + pip install pandas pathlib tensorflow scikit-learn
    for MacOS with M1/M2 chip user, you can install these libraries using pip by running the following command in your terminal
    + pip install pandas 
    + pip install pathlib
    + pip install tensorflow-macos
    + pip install keras

## Summary

To optimize model for a predictive accuracy as close to 1 as possible, using any or all of the following techniques:

+ Adjust the input data by dropping different features columns to ensure that no variables or outliers confuse the model.
+ Add more neurons (nodes) to a hidden layer.
+ Add more hidden layers.
+ Use different activation functions for the hidden layers.
+ Add to or reduce the number of epochs in the training regime.
